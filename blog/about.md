I'm a recent graduate from the University of Cambridge, with an MEng in instrumentation and control engineering. During my time at Cambridge I rowed for my college boat club, represented the university in athletics, and occasionally moonlighted as a balloon artist.

Since graduating I've moved to Copenhagen, Denmark and am enjoying every second of it (except the weather). I'm currently working for Microsoft as a software developer.

This site is my online home for all things code, or otherwise...

...but mainly code.
